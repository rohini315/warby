Here's a quick homework assignment we're asking our Technology Intern applicants to complete. Please see the attached diagram of a lightbox and implement it with HTML/CSS/JS (use the provided files as a starting point, and please don't use any libraries or plug-ins). The page on which the lightbox is superimposed can be empty, we'll only look at the lightbox itself. The diagram is deliberately vague because we'd like to see how you interpret it. Here are a few specific notes to help you along!

- You can think of the scrollbar as a width control for the lightbox.
  - On page load, the lightbox should be 80% of the viewport's width
  - As the user scrolls down the page, the width of the lightbox should shrink
  - At the bottom of the page, the lightbox should be 25% of the viewport's width (by this point it'll be very tall and ugly)
- The lightbox should always be vertically and horizontally centered in the viewport.
- The page that the lightbox lives on should be 2000px tall. (Again, save some time and just make it 2000px of whitespace.)
- The six boxes at the top of the lightbox are images.
- As the width of the lightbox shrinks, the images should shrink proportionally.
- No need to worry about cross-browser compatibility.

An API to help you get started with the data for the lightbox content can be found at: http://homework.warbyparker.com/
Feel free to copy that into your solution, or, better yet, fetch it directly from your code.

Good luck!
